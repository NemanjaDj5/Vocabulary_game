# Vocabulary_game

## Description:
After two and a half months of programming in a Python course, I have developed an application designed for learning the English language

## Files:
- grafikap3 : directory is dedicated to the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, shaping the visual and interactive aspects of the application.
- klasap3 : directory encompasses the backend logic of the application, implemented as a Python class. It handles the core functionality and data processing behind the scenes.
- usernamep3.txt : file functions as a user database, storing information for individuals participating in competitions and interacting with each other within the application.
- recnikp3.txt : file acts as a vocabulary database, containing a collection of words used within the application.
